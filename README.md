# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression- Linear Regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

Here I use Linear Regression model in two projects with two variable, say- first problem named linear_regression.py in which I used dataset.csv file which predict the value of price of area, in second problem named linear_regression_project.py in which I used car_driving_risk_analysis.csv file which predict the risk for car driving speed.

Thank you,
keep learning.
